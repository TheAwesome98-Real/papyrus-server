# Papyrus Server

Papyrus is a high speed Fabric and Paper server for Minecraft: Java Edition.

## Why use this rather than the Cardboard mod for a Fabric server?

The cardboard mod is just Craftbukkit in a Fabric mod -- this can present a few issues for plugins like WorldEdit for example.

Papyrus is Fabric and Paper simultaneously -- plugins can only see a real paper server (and some extra blocks, containers, APIs, etc.), and mods can only see Fabric.
